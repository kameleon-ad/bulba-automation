The problem with the provided code is that it's attempting to apply the `upper()` method to the entire list 'a' instead of individual elements. The `upper()` method is meant to be applied to strings, not lists.

To fix the code, you should iterate over the elements of the list 'a' and apply the `upper()` method to each element. Here's the corrected code:

```python
a = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
b = [x.upper() for x in a]
print(b)
```

This code will correctly convert each element of the list 'a' to uppercase and store the uppercase versions in the list 'b'.
