# Rate The Clarity Of The Prompt

Identify whether the prompt contains sufficient information for an experienced programmer to provide a complete response.

Use the following rubric:

| Option          | Description                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing Context | The prompt seems to refer to: <br> - A previous message <br> - A website (URL) <br> - An image, video or other external media <br> - Some other resource that the LLM cannot access |
| Vague/Ambiguous | Use this if it is unclear what the prompt is asking or if the prompt can be interpreted in more ways than one.                               |
| Completely Clear | The prompt contains sufficient information for an experienced programmer to provide a helpful response.                                      |
