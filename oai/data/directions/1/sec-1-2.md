## Skipping the Task:

- If you're not familiar enough with the code in a task to reasonably rate it, you may skip it so it goes back into the queue and somebody else can take a stab at it.
- Limit the "skip" feature to items where you are truly unable to answer the questions. Remember that youâ€™re encouraged to use any reference material at your disposal.
