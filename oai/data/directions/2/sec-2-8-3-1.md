```
- Prompt
    Explain this code. Go step by step, explaining each line in detail:

    ```javascript
    const re = /\\\\w+\\\\s/g;
    const str = "fee fi fo fum";
    const myArray = str.match(re);
    console.log(myArray);
    ```
- Response
    Sure, here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    ```javascript
    const re = /\\w+\\s/g;
    ```

    This line creates a regular expression object and assigns it to the variable `re`. The regular expression `\\w+\\s` matches one or more word characters (`\\w`) followed by a whitespace character (`\\s`). The `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it global, which means that it will match all occurrences of the pattern in the string.

    ```javascript
    const str = "fee fi fo fum";
    ```

    The next two lines produce the following output:

    ```
    ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]
    ```
