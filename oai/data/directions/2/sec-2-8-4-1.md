- Response
    The output of the following NumPy code is:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    y = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    z = np.dot(x, y)
    print(z)
    ```

    ```
    [[19 22]
    [43 50]]
    ```

    Explanation:

    1. The code first imports the `numpy` library as `np`.
    2. It then creates two NumPy arrays, `x` and `y`, each with two rows and two columns.
    3. The `dot()` function is used to calculate the dot product of `x` and `y`. The dot product of two matrices is a new matrix that is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of the original matrices.
    4. The resulting matrix `z` is printed to the console.

    In this case, the dot product of `x` and `y` is a 2x2 matrix with the following values:
