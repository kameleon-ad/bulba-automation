# How Verbose Is The Response

Important Notes:
This scale goes from "too verbose" to "too short"; the best score here is in the middle!

Use the following rubric:

| Option    | Reason                                                                           | Explanation                                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too Verbose | The response goes on much longer than it should for the prompt it is responding to. | If the response is too verbose, briefly point out the part(s) that could be removed or shortened |
| Just Right | The response is an ideal length for the prompt it is responding to                 | Not required                                                     |
| Too Short | The response is too brief, curt, or cut off. There should be some more framing or some more information. Also choose this option if the response did not include code but would have been substantially better if it had, or if it wrote too little code to address the prompt. | If the response is too short, briefly articulate what information is missing.                |
