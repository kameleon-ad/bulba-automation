- Prompt
    Explain this code. Go step by step, explaining each line in detail:

    ```javascript
    const re = /\\\\w+\\\\s/g;
    const str = "fee fi fo fum";
    const myArray = str.match(re);
    console.log(myArray);
    ```
- Response
    Sure, here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    ```javascript
    const re = /\\w+\\s/g;
    ```

    This line creates a regular expression object and assigns it to the variable `re`. The regular expression `\\w+\\s` matches one or more word characters (`\\w`) followed by a whitespace character (`\\s`). The `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it global, which means that it will match all occurrences of the pattern in the string.

    ```javascript
    const str = "fee fi fo fum";
    ```

    This line creates a string variable `str` and assigns it the value "fee fi fo fum".

    ```javascript
    const myArray = str.match(re);
    ```

    This line calls the `match()` method on the string `str`, passing in the regular expression `re` as an argument. The `match()` method returns an array of all matches of the regular expression in the string. In this case, the array will contain the elements `["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]`.

    ```javascript
    console.log(myArray);
    ```

    The last line prints the contents of the array `myArray` to the console. 

    Let me know if you need further help.
