# Is The Response Truthful And Correct

Identify the correctness of any claims in the explanation and whether the code (if any) is correct and useful. Please take up to 15 minutes to research information across both responses as needed.

Use the following rubric:

| Option        | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Explanation        |

| No Issues     | All claims in both the explanation and any code comments are factual and accurate; the code (if any) is functional, safe, and useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not Required       |
| Minor Issues  | Either or both of the following are true: <ul><li>Text: primary claims (central to addressing the prompt) are factual/accurate; secondary claims contain meaningful inaccuracies (or unfounded claims). <ul><li>Examples include: an otherwise correct explanation of a library that uses an incorrect link, or a description of a system that misconstrues a small detail of its design.</li></ul></li><li>Code: has minor problems that are straightforward to fix (e.g., missing imports, small syntax errors), or is correct but has misleading comments.</li></ul> | Required if issues are found. Describe all issues. |
| Major Issues  | Either or both of the following are true: <ul><li>Text: primary claims contain meaningful inaccuracies (or unfounded claims), such that the response is not helpful to the user. <ul><li>For example, a response that seriously mischaracterizes the design or usage of a library, or a response that mischaracterizes what the code does.</li></ul></li><li>Code: has one or more of the following problems: <ul><li>Do not use this to flag responses that make simplifying assumptions that a user would reasonably be expected to notice and improve, such as using a hard-coded password in a clearly visible location. </li><li>Functionality: the program does not compile or run and would require substantial effort to repair.</li><li>Safety: the code would create safety or security risks if used, such as relying on libraries with known vulnerabilities or failing to sanitize user inputs.</li><li>Performance: the code is unnecessarily slow, for instance, due to using a quadratic algorithm where a (log-)linear option exists, or repeatedly concatenating long strings instead of using a stringbuilder.</li><li>Documentation: the comments contain meaningful inaccuracies that make the code very hard to understand.</li></ul></li></ul> <br> Important Note: <br> Keep in mind that the code may be functional for the prompter, even if it does not compile or run on your setup. For instance, a response that points to a file only accessible to the prompter, or provides a partial program based on the context provided by the prompter should not be marked as non-functional unless it contains errors that would (likely) manifest in the prompterâ€™s programming context. | Required if issues are found. Describe all issues. |
| Cannot Assess | Cannot determine validity of claims made in the response, or response is a punt ("I am not able to answer that type of question") Select this option if properly researching the claims in the response would take >15 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Not Required       |
| N/A           | No explicit or implicit claims are made in the response and it does not include code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Not Required       |
