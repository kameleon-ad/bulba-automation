| Low           | You are uncertain whether your choice accurately reflects the superior model.                                                  | Not required                  |
| Medium        | It is possible for another tasker to have a different opinion.                                                                 | Not required                  |
| High          | You are certain that one model is superior to the other or are the same. You believe other taskers would share the same opinion. | Not required                  |
| Could Not Judge | Use sparingly for cases where the prompt is either not at all code related, or where you completely lack the expertise to rate the responses. Your inputs to all other questions will be ignored. | Briefly explain why the prompt is not code-related, or what expertise is required to answer the question if you skipped it. |
